// #[instant] lets the compiler know the current code/function has a direct affect on the compiler or a program outside of the compiler
// `require_all` tells the compiler every field of a struct is required
// `require` is a keyword that tells the compiler something is required in a struct/function
//	You can use `require` in function arguments to make sure a specific argument is passed.
//	By default, functions args in Emp are optional.
//	ToDo: Change this?
// #[ignore] lets the compiler know to completely skip the next line of code
// #[ignore_function] lets the compiler know to ignore the entire function

// #[arch=archType] tells the compiler what architecture we're compiling for
// `package filename` packages all the source code within the given file, and `compiled` it into a custom bytecode that the compiler can easily unpackage and read
//	A package is a clump, multiple clumps or an entire file of code that is translated into Emps Custome Bytecode for Packages(ECBP).
//	ECBP is custom bytecode that the compiler is programmed to easily read and "unpackage" all the code. Since this isn't machine code, a ECBP generated
//	binary file will (most likely) be larger in size, thus requiring more attention to memory usage within a project.
//	ECBP was created for simplicity with packages in Emp. The package system in Emp wants a package to not be compiled alone, but rather, be compiled as part
//	of the actual source code. So, to bypass compiling a package to machine code, I created my own file format/custom bytecode for the compiler to "compile" a
//	package into a custom binary-type file.
//	Simply Put It: Packages are not source code, they are "collections" of code that will reside/be used inside an actual source-code file.
//		       Packages, upon importation, will be "unpackaged" and all the code will be available. Upon "unpackaging", the binary ECBP file is deleted.
// A source-code file can store multiple packages
// The source-code file will be compiled to the according machine code depending on the target architecture.
// The packages within the source-code file will get a ECBP binary file with the source-code filename included in the name. This is an example:
//	source-code file: sfile.emp
//	ECBP file generated from individual packages located in sfile.emp: sfile_pkgs.ecbp
// The compiler will "assemble" together the ECBP binary file in a way that the compiler can also "disassemble" when included in a source-code file.
// The ECBP binary file will look differently than a code-file that is one package of-itself. The ECBP binary file will include multiple different chunks
// that describe each individual package the compiler finds within the source-code file.
// Meanwhile, for a code-file that is one package, the ECBP binary file will hold data only for the file, and there will not be more than one "package" chunk.

// #[c_types] tells the compiler we want to use the data types C/C++ use
// #[rust_types] tells the compiler we want to use the data types Rust has

// #[required_methods=method,names,separated,by,comma] tells the compiler that the following ideal(struct/class)
//	requires specific methods to be called throughout the programs lifetime. It also tells the compiler
//	what methods need to be implemented for the specific class/struct.
// #[uses=methods,that,will,be,used,separated,by,comma] tells the compiler that the following function, struct etc
// 	uses specific ideals. The compiler will, thusly, error if these specific methods/function calls
//	(or whatever they are) are not present.
// #[memory=allow_attr] tells the compiler what things can be done with memory(copying the memory, transfering memory address etc).
//	allow_copy - The memory of whatever it is will be capable of being copied by another variable.
//		     This forces you to watch your memory a bit more.
//	allow_transfer - The memory of whatver it is will be capable of moving from one memory location to another
//	packed - The memory address takes up as little memory as possible
//	shared - The memory address will eventually be transfered to another address and destroyed.
//		 `shared` is used mainly with structs. When you finally `transfer` the memory address to the next struct,
//		 the struct must contain the data of which the `shared` struct contains.
//		 This helps with many things. Example, we might need a struct with little data to do one thing before we init another struct
//		 that requires the same data. So, instead of getting rid of the memory and re-allocating, we simply "transfer" the address
//		 of the struct with "shared" memory to the new struct that has the same data, and more.
//		 If the memory is `shared`, the compiler requires the user to specify what the memory will eventually become.
//		 This is done via `turns_to`.
//		 Example:
//		 #[memory=shared]
//		 require_all struct Example turns_to Example2
//		 {
//			uint8	a;
//			uint8	b;
//		 } _Example2;
//		 
//		 #[inherits=Example]
//		 #[memory=allow_copy,allow_transfer]
//		 require_all struct Example2
//		 {
//			// Same data as `Example`
//		 	uint8	a;
//		 	uint8	b;
//
//			// New data
//			uint8	c;
//			uint8 	d;
//		 }
//		 Example, and it's address, will be used until `Example2` is initialized, then `Example` and it's address is "transfered" to Example2.
//	boxed - The memory is statically allocated(stack allocated) until runtime. At runtime, the memory
//		will become a `buffer` data type, and will be delt with via the compiler.
//	open - This implies that the memory has the attributes allow_copy, allow_transfer. It also implies
//	       that the memory is a `ptr` type.
//	def_mem - The default memory is considered a `raw_ptr`. By default, all "pointers", or anything to do with memory, is a `raw_ptr`.
//		  A `raw_ptr` is a ptr with a fixed address. A `raw_ptr` cannot be expanded upon. It cannot be decreased in size. Whatever
//		  memory is available is all you get.
//	By default, structs/classes etc are a `raw_ptr`. Upon initialization for memory, the compiler makes the memory address a `raw_ptr` until the user
//	tells the compiler otherwise via the #[memory=] attribute.

// Example
#[required_methods=init,destory]
#[uses=wr, fl]
#[memory=allow_copy, allow_transfer]

// The following function takes in a type of char, and tells the compiler to treat it as a integer
// Note: If the variable type passed as a argument is unsigned, the type we tell the compiler to treat the variable as has to be unsigned aswell
// Note: If the variable type passed as a argument is a ptr, the type we tell the compiler to treat the variable as has to be a ptr as well
fn something(var1 u8)
	treat var1 as u32
{
	// lets say `var1` has a value of 'a'
	//	var1 = 01000001
	// Now, `var1` has the value 01000001 00000000 00000000 00000000
	// The first byte is reserved throughout the function. So, anytime the variable
	// changes, the first byte is always 'a'. This is where useful techniques come in, such as doing:
	var2: u8 ptr = var1;

	// In Emp, if you have a type that is larger than the variable being assigned to it, the compiler
	// assigns only that much bytes(depending on the variables data type) to the variable.
	// So, since the compiler is treating `var1` as a u32 in the function `something`, the compiler
	// sees `var2` only has access to a single byte, thus it assigns only the first byte of the `u32` type `var1`,
	// thus, `var2` now equals 'a'. Not just that, we also tell the compiler `var2` is a `u8 ptr`, meaning
	// `var2` points to the address of the first byte, thus `var2` now points to the original address of `var1`.
	// This is how you can change the original value. Now, if we do:
	*var2 = 'b';
	
	// The first byte of `var1` will be 'b', and the `u32` reference of `var1` that exists during the function lifetime(unless returned) is now: 01000010 00000000 00000000 00000000
	// Again, if the function `something` returns the `u32` reference of `var1`, the variable assigned to the return
	// of the function `something` will obtain the given amount of bytes from the `u32` reference of `var1`.
	// Another words, if we have a `u8` variable `var3` assigned to the return value of `something`, `var3` will
	// store the value 'b', and `var3` will obtain the "extended memory" that `var1` inherited within the function `something` so it could store a 4-byte value.
}

// Example(ignore the fact we don't have a main function lol):
var1: u8 = 'a';
var2: u8 = something(var1);

// Lets say `something(var1)` returns 01000010 01000001 01100110 00000001
// `var2` will have the value 01000010 assigned to it('b')
// If we do:
var2 = (var2 >> 8) & 0xFF;
// `var2` will now have the value 01000001 assigned to it('a')
var2 = (var2 >> 24) & 0xFF;
// `var2` will now have the value 00000001
// OR, if we want to access any of the extended memory, should we do:
//	var2 = access_extended_memory(variable, byte, size);
// where `variable` is the varibale that stores the "extended memory", and `byte` is the index in the extended memory that we want to begin at, and `size`
// is the total amount of bytes we want to obtain(return from the function).
// So, if we tell `access_extended_memory` to start at byte 2, the `size` can only be 2 since there is no more than 2 bytes left in the extended memory.
// If we tell the `access_extended_memory` function to access a size greater than a variable(assigning 2 bytes to a u8, for example), 
// the compiler will default the size to the variable size.
// If we tell the `access_extended_memory` function to access a size that would surpass the size of the "extended memory", then the compiler will return
// the rest of the value of the extended memory. For example:
//	var2 = access_extended_memory(var2, 2, 2);
// We tell `access_extended_memory` to begin at the second byte of the extended memory of variable `var2`, and to return 2 bytes.
// However, `var2` is a `u8`, so the compiler will, in theory, only return the third byte of the variables extended memory.
// Remember: the `byte` argument tells the `access_extended_memory` function where to start at in the extended memory. The function thus returns x amount of              bytes(size) that follows after the beginning byte
// Another example(assuming var2 is a u32):
//	var2 = access_extended_memory(var2, 2, 4);
// We tell `access_extended_memory` to start at the second byte of the extended memory and to return the next 4 bytes. However, that goes 2 bytes above the
// total extended memory possible. So, `access_extended_memory` will return only 2 bytes to `var2` instead of 4 since there was not 4 bytes left in the extended memory
// to return.
